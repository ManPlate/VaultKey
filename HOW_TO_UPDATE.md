# 🔄 How to Update VaultKey

Updating VaultKey is simple and **your passwords are never affected** — they live in a separate folder on your computer, completely independent of the app file.

---

## ✅ Before You Update

**Your data is safe.** All your passwords are stored in:
```
C:\Users\YourName\.vaultkey\
```
Replacing the app file does **not** touch this folder. You will not lose any passwords.

## 🚀 How to Update (2 steps)

### Step 1 — Get the new version
Receive the new `VaultKey.exe` from whoever manages the app (the person who shared it with you).

### Step 2 — Replace the old file
Find where you saved the old `VaultKey.exe` on your computer (e.g. your Desktop or Downloads folder).

**Delete the old `VaultKey.exe` and put the new one in the same place.**

That's it. Open the new `VaultKey.exe` — all your passwords will be exactly as you left them.

## 🔍 How to Check Your Version

Open VaultKey and look at the top left corner — the version number is displayed next to the logo (e.g. `v1.2.0`).

You can also click the **"ℹ About"** button in the top right to see the full version history and what changed in each update.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Will I need to re-enter all my passwords after updating?**
No. Your passwords are stored separately from the app and will be there automatically when you open the new version.

**Do I need to uninstall the old version first?**
No. VaultKey doesn't install itself — it's just a single `.exe` file. Simply delete the old one and use the new one.

**What if the new version asks me to create a master password again?**
This means the new `VaultKey.exe` is in a different folder from where the old one was. Make sure you open the new file from the same location, or move your `.vaultkey` data folder to match. Contact the person who shared the app for help.
